    <p>
      New York City will be attempting one of the most complicated
      instructional challenges the nation’s largest school district has ever
      undertaken. The 2020-2021 school year is set to begin next week with a
      blended learning model, whereby only a portion of students will be in
      schools each day with the rest learning remotely. Along with the
      logistical challenges of such a model, it is imperative that the health,
      safety and well-being of our students, teachers and staff comes first as
      they begin to gather indoors.
    </p>

    <p>
      To work successfully, this moment of crisis requires flexibility and
      creativity, but it also requires a steadfast commitment to equity. We
      know that remote learning was an obstacle for many students, especially
      for those already disadvantaged and at risk. As we enter this new school
      year, it is vital that we take into account lessons learned earlier and
      structure learning to support students with unique needs and challenges
      as best we possibly can.
    </p>

    <p>
      CCC understands the concerns of teachers and principals that have led to
      a delayed start to the school year. During this added time as well as
      into the first few months of transition the city must continue to
      develop and support practices that benefit those with the most to lose
      from long-term remote learning.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Prioritize In-Person Learning for the Youngest and Most Vulnerable
    </h2>

    <p>
      Schools are set to open under a variety of hybrid
      <a href="https://www.uft.org/news/news-stories/does-scheduling-models-2020-21-school-year"
        target="_blank">models</a>, all based on different cohorts of students attending school at
      different times to reduce capacity and ensure social distancing.
      However, no priority was given for some students to receive more
      in-person instruction based on academic and other needs (only District
      75 schools exclusively for students with disabilities were given the
      option to offer full-time in-person learning).
    </p>

    <h3>Students in Grades K-5</h3>
    <div class="graph-wrapper pull-quote">
      <p>There were 479,411 students in K-5 in 2019-2020 School Year</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Elementary school-aged children have the most to lose from attending
      remotely or only sometimes in-person. A
      <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/07/schools-should-prioritize-reopening-in-fall-2020-especially-for-grades-k-5-while-weighing-risks-and-benefits"
        target="_blank">study </a>released in July concluded “In grades K-3, children are still
      developing the skills to regulate their own behavior, emotions, and
      attention, and therefore struggle with distance learning.” This in
      addition to the challenges of learning to read, write and develop other
      foundational skills remotely. City Councilmember and Chair of the
      Education Committee Mark Treyger
      <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/6fe866f4b5e485eb450be1baa/files/35529bf0-0663-47f7-ad99-08388a273a6b/School_Reopening_Proposal_CM_Treyger_07242020.pdf"
        target="_blank">called </a>for prioritization of young students for in-person instruction, also
      noting the logistical advantage of offering younger students in-person
      school would make remote learning easier for older students who were
      previously tasked with watching them at home.
    </p>

    <h3>Students in Temporary Housing</h3>
    <p>
      Students in temporary housing, including those in shelters or doubled-up
      in homes. often lack access to a reliable internet connection, or a
      personal device to call their own, or both. They are more likely to lack
      the physical space to learn remotely where they live, especially those
      who might also have siblings who are also remote-learning, and they may
      not have a caregiver present to help them set up their access or guide
      them throughout the school day.
    </p>

    <p>
      In April,
      <a
        href="https://www.cccnewyork.org/blog/students-in-temporary-housing-and-distance-learning-a-unique-challenge-of-the-citys-covid-19-response/">CCC
        highlighted these issues</a>
      to call on the Dept. of Education (DOE) to expedite delivery of internet
      devices to the over 114,000 students in temporary housing and grant them
      access to temporary in-person learning centers. This upcoming school
      year, these students continue to be among the most vulnerable and CCC
      was proud to join many other organizations
      <a href="https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/sites/default/files/on_page/NP_sth_reopening_sign_on_letter_8.2020.pdf?pt=1"
        targe="_blank">to call on the city and DOE</a>
      to offer these students full-time in-person instruction or priority in
      learning spaces, adequate transportation notification, and increased
      attention to their digital barriers. We were pleased to see the
      <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enrollment-help/learning-bridges" target="_blank">Dept. of
        Education inquire</a>
      about students in shelters in their survey for the Learning Bridges
      school-day child care plan this school year.
    </p>
    <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>
      Students with disabilities comprise over 20% of the entire New York City
      student population and are at particular risk of falling behind during
      remote learning. They are also more likely to rely on in-person adult
      support—meaning that a student’s ability to benefit from the instruction
      and services offered during remote learning often depends on their
      parent’s availability, language, resources, and technology skills.
      Advocates for Children recently released a
      <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7047721-Special-Ed-Reopening-Recommendations-8-2020.html"
        target="_blank">detailed list of recommendations </a>for students with disabilities this upcoming school year,
      including
      recommending that the DOE “offer full-time in-person instruction to all
      students in self-contained special education classes” and “offer
      multiple options for families who want in-person related services,
      including receiving services in schools, at the City’s new “Learning
      Bridges” child care programs, at home, and at related service agencies.”
      Importantly, these recommendations draw a distinction between students
      in self-contained special education classes, and the many students whose
      IEPs require that they learn in integrated environments with general
      population students. As best as hybrid schedules can accommodate,
      students with disabilities must continue to learn, both remotely and
      in-person, in the least restrictive environments.
    </p>
    <h3>English Language Learners</h3>
    <p>
      Before the pandemic English language learners in the DOE
      <a
        href="https://www.cccnewyork.org/blog/multilingual-learners-in-nyc-schools-poor-outcomes-with-unlimited-potential/">saw
        some of the worst academic outcomes</a>
      of any subgroup of students, with higher dropout rates and lower
      graduation rates despite their vast potential. Remote learning is likely
      to exacerbate these disparate outcomes,
      <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/8/31/21408598/nycs-reopening-plans-leave-behind-students-who-arent-fluent-in-english-educators-say"
        target="_blank">with the children of immigrants likely to not speak English at
        home</a>, and may have struggled with accessing and using technology. The
      complex nature of the upcoming school year has steepened the
      communication barrier for these families, who are often left out of
      receiving vital information about scheduling, transportation or meals.
      The DOE reopening plan should allow English language learners to receive
      more in-person instruction and make a concerted effort to reach
      immigrant families in a variety of ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are barely a week away from the start of school, which has already
      been delayed once, and a wholesale redesign of an already complex
      learning structure is likely only to cause more problems. But as the
      school year commences and we receive anecdotal data on remote-learning
      issues (likely the same ones we’ve been hearing about for months) the
      city and the DOE must keep these students in mind and develop strategies
      to prioritize their learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the DOE first offered the option to receive entirely remote
      instruction they announced that
      <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/8/10/21362313/a-quarter-of-nyc-students-opt-out-of-school-buildings"
        target="_blank">25% of families</a>
      had chosen that option. As recently as August 31st, that number had
      grown to
      <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetBenMax/status/1303704045463441408" target="_blank">nearly 40%</a>, and the
      option to go fully remote can be taken by families at any
      time during the school year. This means schools may have more space than
      originally anticipated, and that families were likely dissatisfied with
      the in-person options presented to them over the summer. As this unique
      school year starts to take focus, the DOE should consider issuing
      central guidance to expand in-person instruction to younger and
      vulnerable students, or at least give principals the option to do so.

    <h2>Ensure All Educational Settings are Flexible and Prepared</h2>
    <h3>Early Care and Education</h3>

    <p>
      Early care and education has never been as important as it is in our
      current moment; to help working families get back to work, to support
      child development, and to address social emotional trauma created by the
      pandemic. New York City’s expansive system of early care and education,
      including universal Pre-K, Pre-K for three-year-olds, subsidized infant
      toddler care in centers and home-based settings and care provided
      through vouchers, must be given the same attention, preparation, and
      flexibility afforded to the public school system. Earlier this summer
      <a
        href="https://www.cccnewyork.org/blog/positioning-nycs-early-care-and-education-system-for-a-successful-long-term-recovery/">CCC
        released a set of priorities</a>
      for early care and education in order to position it as part of the
      city’s COVID recovery. These priorities included protecting the system’s
      capacity, meeting children’s social-emotional needs through integrated
      practices, and continuing to support the development of remote
      programming and supporting this critical workforce.

    <h3>Afterschool</h3>

    <p>
      The city’s robust network of afterschool programs and youth services
      must also be part of the restart plan. To date, afterschool providers,
      which served over
      <a
        href="https://www.cccnewyork.org/blog/youth-services-in-nyc-who-they-serve-and-why-they-are-necessary-to-a-covid-recovery-plan/">220,000
        children last school year</a>, have been planning to run the city’s Learning Bridges program for
      school-age child care, but have received very little support in
      developing safe and effective afterschool programs for the upcoming
      school year. In fact, guidance issued to schools to keep children in the
      same learning pods has led some principals to decline their usual
      offering of school-based afterschool. Providers who have expressed
      interest and capacity to run both Learning Bridges during the school day
      and an afterschool program are still waiting for guidance on how to keep
      youth enrolled in both programs safely. Additionally, afterschool
      programs have not been awarded the same flexibility as schools to offer
      remote services, which they did so effectively throughout the spring and
      summer months.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many afterschool programs, serve the communities that have been
      <a href="https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/map/1424/covid-19-cases#1424/a/6/1702/80/a/a" target="_blank">hit
        hardest by the pandemic</a>, and their programs have always been vital to the academic,
      social-emotional, and physical well-being of youth. These providers and
      CBOs must be intimately involved in the new school year to ensure the
      entire educational continuum is safe, effective and supportive.

    <h2>Support the Behavioral Health Needs of Students</h2>
    <p>
      With the transition to distance learning, many children have lost a
      source of stability and routine, and may experience feelings of
      <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2764730" target="_blank">social isolation and
        anxiety</a>. Many LGBTQ students may face heightened challenges if they live in
      unsupportive families and have lost their in-person connection to a more
      affirming school community. Additionally, the shuttering of schools has
      impaired the ability to identify and connect or maintain continuity of
      student’s access to clinical services. The importance of schools as a
      setting through which to receive clinical services is clear; a national
      study from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that
      more than 13% of adolescents received some form of mental health
      services in a school setting in the
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK362074/" target="_blank">previous 12 months.</a>
      Additionally,
      <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josh.12753" target="_blank">35% of adolescents</a>
      who receive any mental health services receive them exclusively from
      school settings. Schools will remain an important site – whether
      physical or virtual – for connecting children to emotional and
      behavioral supports. More in depth recommendations on school-based
      behavioral health will be forthcoming from CCC.
    </p>
    <p>
      This school year will be a new frontier in the educational landscape of
      New York City, and it will have lasting implications on all facets of
      our COVID-19 recovery and beyond. Along with its commitment to health
      and safety, the city and the DOE must focus its efforts over the next
      year on equity, paying particular attention to our youngest students,
      students with special needs, and the essential role that the broader
      educational continuum including early care and education, youth
      services, and behavioral health care providers play in supporting the
      well-being and academic success of students.
